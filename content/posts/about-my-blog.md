## Who am I?

An university student in Japan. Formaly worked as a frontend web engineer (mainly write React/TypeScript/etc).

## What is this blog?

This is my first article on this blog so I wanna tell you about me, a little bit. 

I'm not living in US now and have never visited before. So my English skill is pretty bad. Especially in speaking and writing. But my ex-coworkers were all English speakers (of cource including non-native speakers, however all of them speaks English pretty well in comparison with me lol). Currently it didn't make any problems on the daily job before, but I want to communicate with those people more. My first aim is writing all posts in English.

And now I am learning some mathematics and computer science in my college, sadly I've forgot almost everything I had learned in the university. So, for now, I wanna try to make some notes that can be useful for learning them.

## What am I interested in now?

My current goals are:

- Learn basis of calculus.
- Make some backend applications in Rust.

To be honest, for mathematics, I am complitely a novice. So if you find a mistake, please let me know.
