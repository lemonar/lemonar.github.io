There are 2 useful tips when you make an actual blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages:
Use snap for installation (for Linux users) Snapcraft is a relatively new package system for Linux.</description>

      <description>Who am I? An university student in Japan. Formaly worked as a frontend web engineer (mainly write React/TypeScript/etc).
What is this blog? This is my first article on this blog so I wanna tell you about me, a little bit.
I&amp;rsquo;m not living in US now and have never visited before. So my English skill is pretty bad. Especially in speaking and writing. But my ex-coworkers were all English speakers (of cource including non-native speakers, however all of them speaks English pretty well in comparison with me lol).</description>
